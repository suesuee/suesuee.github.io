            Hi, I'm <strong>Sue</strong>, a Computer Science student at
            California Polytechnic State University. I'm passionate about
            technology, with experience in AI, software development, and
            hands-on projects. I'm always looking for new challenges to learn
            and grow, whether it's working on coding projects or exploring
            digital tools like 3D printing. This site showcases my projects,
            experiences, and what I'm working on as I continue my journey in
            tech.
